# Increase the Accuracy

1. Increase the Data.
(If you dont have sutaible configuration then follows given method to train) - Increamental Learnning
Incremental Learning (a.k.a. Online Learning)

***Definition:
Incremental learning means training a model step by step, with small batches of new data, instead of training from scratch on the entire dataset every time.
The model remembers old knowledge and learns new patterns without forgetting.
***
    a) Clean text in chunks rather than loading all at once. Use Pandas chunksize to read large CSV in parts:
    import pandas as pd

    ```
    for chunk in pd.read_csv("quora_data.csv", chunksize=50000):
        # preprocess and train batch by batch
        print(chunk.shape)
    ```
    b) Use vaex/Dask library 
    c) use tensorflow/keras

2. Apply more preprocessing like stemming 
3. Apply more algorithm with hyperparameter tuning
    - also search about cross validation
4. create more features
5. use different text representation
6. try to deep leaning approach
